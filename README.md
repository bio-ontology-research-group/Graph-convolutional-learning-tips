# Graph-convolutional-learning-tips
A repo for everybody to fill with resources and tips on graph convolutional neural networks and how to train them. 

There will be some introductory papers and and tutorials linked for easier assessment of the topic, but also a curated collection of interesting and supportive papers. All tasks are introduced with respect to problems from the field of computational bioscience.

### General introductory blogs

- [tutorial from missinglink.ai](https://missinglink.ai/guides/convolutional-neural-networks/graph-convolutional-networks/) explaining the formulas and methodology
- [tutorial describing the different possible tasks](https://www.section.io/engineering-education/an-introduction-to-graph-neural-network/)
- [first paper introducing graph convolutional neural networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.02907.pdf) by Thomas Kipf

### Subtasks for graph convolutional neural networks

There are several tasks to be performed over graphs which can be classified in the following categories. Different GCN layer types may perform different with respect to these task.

#### Semi-/supervised tasks

##### Graph classification
e.g. embedding drugs with respect to their molecular structure
- []

##### Node classification
e.g. predicting 
- []


##### Link prediction
e.g. predicting protein-protein-interactions (PPIs) in a PPI graph (e.g. STRING)


#### Unsupervised tasks

##### Graph autoencoders w.r.t to nodes

##### Graph autoencoders w.r.t to whole graphs


### Frameworks
